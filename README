WEBCAM CAPTURE AND FADE

This program is made for the science center Vitenfabrikken in Sandnes, Norway. It captures images from a normal webcamera in Windows and fades between the captured images.

The program is made February/March for 2010 for the exhibition "Kem e Sandnes?" ("Who is Sandnes?"). The exhibition will be/is opened on 14th of April.

Some features:
- A picture is only shown once in the fading images
- Pictures captures is saved with the current time and date
- With no camera connected, the program won't start (gives a error message)
- Debug by pressing t, y or u (more can be added in keyPressed())

Program is written by Hallvard Nygård <hn@jaermuseet.no> for Vitenfabrikken (part of Jærmuseet)
