WEBCAM CAPTURE AND FADE

This program is made for the science center Vitenfabrikken in Sandnes, Norway.
It captures images from a normal webcamera in Windows and fades between
the captured images.

The program is made during the spring of 2010 for the exhibition "Kem e Sandnes?"
("Who is Sandnes?"). The exhibition will be/is opened on 14th of April by the
queen of Norway.


Some features:
- A picture is only shown once in the fading images (layout1280())
- Pictures captures is saved with the current time and date
- Last pictures captured as shown more often than older once 
  (number of pictures considered last pictures is controlled by lastadded_max,
  percentage of new images vs old images is given by percentage_of_new_images)
- Newly captured images are, with layout1024(), force to be the next image to 
  fade to if the image is not fading at the moment.
- 5 seconds between each captured image
- Pictures that are in use (fading out or fading in) is cached by the program.
  Others are loaded from disk once its needed.
- Timeout for capture window
- Configurable amount of frames to hold a picture before changing to the next
- Optional blinking red border around new images. Color can be configured.
- With no camera connected, the program won't start (gives a error message)
- Debug by pressing t, y or u (more can be added in keyPressed())
- Border around the pictures (layout1024())
- Date of the picture in lower right corner (layout1024())


Program is tested with 256M heap size on Windows XP and Windows 7.
